# Match 3 game

The Match 3 game was developed during three weeks in Unity3D as a one-man project.

The goal is to remove all the tiles by clicking on them or by getting three or more tiles in a row, either vertically or horizontally. The number of tiles can be set before the game starts by changing the number of rows and columns. If you click on a tile it is removed and all tiles above it will fall down.

## Instructions

- Set the number of rows and columns if you wish (default is a 10 x 10 size board = 100 tiles).
- Click the "vertical matching" button to toggle vertical matching on/off.
- Use the W,A,S,D keys to move the camera and hold down shift and W/S to zoom in/out.
- Click any tile to remove it. 
- The game ends once all the tiles have been removed.

Enjoy!
